## Code accompanying []

This repository contains both code necessary to reproduce the data presented in the manuscript, as well as an interactive viewer for any curious reader to immediately explore the system. 

To simply view results of simulations, a docker container is provided. 
``` docker run -p 8050:8050 dlivitz/chemrev ```
The code relies on the python package pyodesys
